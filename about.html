            <h2>Nick Neely</h2>

            <p>
              I'm currently in the final stretch of my academic journey at
              Indian Hills Community College, where I'm pursuing a degree in
              Computer Software Development. My passion for technology is
              matched only by my love for creating and problem-solving, a
              passion that's evident in my penchant for building Lego
              structures. Just like software development, Lego allows me to
              construct, iterate, and bring imaginative concepts to life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Away from the keyboard, I cherish my time at the gym, where I
              challenge my limits and strive for personal growth. Fitness, for
              me, is not just a hobby; it's a discipline that mirrors the
              dedication I bring to my professional endeavors.
            </p>

            <p>
              At home, I'm greeted by the enthusiastic wagging tail of my
              12-year-old yellow lab, Rex, and the playful antics of my
              6-month-old Maine Coon cat, Oliver â€“ affectionately known as
              Ollie. They bring a sense of joy and companionship to my life,
              reminding me of the simple pleasures amidst a world driven by
              technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              As I stand on the cusp of completing my degree, I'm eager to
              transition the skills and knowledge I've acquired into practical,
              real-world applications. I'm excited to embark on the next phase
              of my career, where I can contribute, grow, and innovate within
              the realm of software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my academic and personal pursuits, I find joy in
              the time I spend with my girlfriend, Juli. Despite the distance
              that separates us, the 3-hour journey to see her is always
              worthwhile, as it brings a sense of adventure and closeness to our
              relationship.
